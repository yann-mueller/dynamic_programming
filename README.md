### Formulation Optimization Problem
For illustrative reasons we use a simplistic T-period (potentially infinite) optimization problem where one has to choose a sequence *{c<sub>1</sub>,...,c<sub>T</sub>}* subject to the period objective function *u(c<sub>t</sub>)* and the constraint *c<sub>t</sub>=y* across all periods:

*V<sup>T</sup>(y)* is the solution to the given optimization problem and *Î²* a period discount factor. Such a sequential optimization problem can be re-written into a recursive formulation:

which is called the **Bellman equation** in which the time indices have been dropped and a new state variable *W'* has been introduced with the law of motion *W'=W-c+y* governing the evolution of the constraint across periods. For a detailed explanation of this derivation and under which assumption it is valid, we refer to [De la Fuente (2000)](#references).
The main purpose of this repository, however, is to show how the Bellman equation can be solved using numerical methods.


### Value Function Iteration
The Value Function Iteration (VFI) is a numerical solution approach based on a discretization of state variables and an iterative maximization process to find an approximate solution close to the true solution.

**Approach:**

<ins>1) Discretization of State Variables:</ins>

Choose a reasonably sized grid for every state variable. In our example, a *1 x N* vector: ***W** ={w<sub>1</sub>,...,w<sub>N</sub>}*

<ins>2) Construction of Flow Matrix:</ins>

Constructing a *N x N* flow matrix that contains the flow part for every possible combination of states today (i.e., ***W***) and states tomorrow (i.e., ***W'***)
